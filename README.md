Below, explain what a http request is.


HTTP means HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web and this protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands.

An HTTP request header is a component of a network packet sent by a browser or client to the server to request for a specific page or data on the Web server. It is used in Web communications or Internet browsing to transport user requests to the corresponding website's Web server

these are text book defintions but i think i at least get this part down. 
the http request is just like a resturant server that takes a request, goes snd retireves that request info and brings it back
